# COPPD (Front-End)

I run a small side business selling limited/rare sneakers and clothing. I keep track of my inventory and sales using Microsoft Excel, which doesn't really offer an intuitive experience for what I'm using it for. I realized I had a need for something better, so I decided to build something for my final project that fulfilled this need.

For my final project for General Assembly's WDI, I built a visual sneaker inventory tracking system to keep a record of all of my purchases. The web app allows you to save information about each item, its costs, and an image that's obtained using Google's Custom Search API.

The front-end was built on React using React Router to handle routing. The data is saved to a PostgreSQL database using a Rails back-end.

The app currently allows the storing of purchased items but the next steps would be to add functionality for sales and analytics. Once these two functionalities are implemented, I hope to move my tracking from Excel to COPPD.
